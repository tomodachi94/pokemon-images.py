# `pokemon_images.py`

A small library with no dependencies to get a random image of a Pokémon.

Usage is simple: `import pokemon_images`, then `pokemon_images.get_random_url`.

## Some notes

There are no accented `é`s in this library to aid typing on keyboards that do not have this key. In all cases, `é` should be replaced by `e` except in documentation.

This library is fully typed and fully documented with Python docstrings.

Contributions are welcome, but this library is considered feature-complete.
